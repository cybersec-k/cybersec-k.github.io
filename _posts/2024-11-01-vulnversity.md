## Task 2: Reconnaissance using Nmap

Start with `nmap` scan to get an overview of the target using the `-sV` flag

> -sV: Attempts to determine the version of the services running
{: .prompt-info }

```bash
$ nmap -sV 10.10.36.68
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org )
Nmap scan report for ip-10-10-36-68.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.10.36.68)
Host is up (0.0049s latency).

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 21.67 seconds                                                      
```

We can see ports `21, 22, 139, 445, 3128 and 3333` are open and likely running `Ubuntu` OS

Web servers usually run on port `80` but here, the Apache web server is running on port `3333`. Might be interesting for further investigation

## Task 3: Locating directories using Gobuster

Seeing the presence of a web server, we'll enumerate the directories using `Gobuster` by providing a wordlist

> On Kali Linux, wordlists are located in `/usr/share/wordlists`
{: .prompt-tip }

```bash
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.36.68:3333 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-1.0.txt

```

In a browser, explore the URL and the directories found with Gobuster. Navigating to `http://10.10.36.68:3333/internal`, we find an upload form, giving an opportunity to upload a malicious payload

> **What is the directory that has an upload form page?**
  ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>/internal/</details>


## Task 4: Compromise the Webserver using Burpsuite

Try uploading a `.txt` or `.php` file and it returns a `Extension not allowed` message so the form only accepts certain file extensions 

![Extension not allowed](ext_not_allowed.png)

> **What common file type you'd want to upload to exploit the server is blocked? Try a couple to find out.**
  >*<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>.php</details>*

Using `Burpsuite`, we will utilize the `Proxy` and `Intruder` tools to fuzz the upload form to see which extensions it will accept and craft our payload depending on that

1. In the `Proxy` tab, open Burp's browser and turn Intercept on
2. Navigate to `<IP address>/internal` page and upload a file
3. In Burp, you'll see the request being intercepted. Click Action and send it to `Intruder`
4. In the `Intruder` tab, select `Sniper` as the attack type, highlight the `.extension` of your file and add a payload marker ยง. This is the variable that will be changed in each upload attempt, trying each entry in the `phpext.txt` file
5. In the `Payloads` tab, load `phpext.txt` in the Payload Options section
6. Click Start Attack

> Press `Clear ยง` to clear existing payload markers before you add your own
{: .prompt-tip }
> Uncheck the URL Encoding option at the bottom or the uploads will encode `.` as `%2e` and all fuzzing attempts will be unsuccessful
{: .prompt-warning }

![Intruder Setup](intruder_setup.png)

![Payload](payload.png)

View the results and check the responses for each file extension. Only `.phtml` has a different file length and a `Success` response. This is the extension we will use for our payload

![Intruder](intruder_success.png)

> **What extension is allowed after running the above exercise?**
  ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>.phtml</details>

### Getting a Reverse Shell

We will attempt to upload a reverse shell that executes on the target and calls back to us to make a connection

In the reverse shell php file, edit the `$ip` variable and rename the file with a `.phtml` extension

```bash
$ mv php-reverse-shell.php php-reverse-shell.phtml
```

![IP](ip.png)

Start a `netcat` listener to listen for any incoming connections. After uploading and executing the reverse shell, we should see an established connection and a bash prompt where we can enter commands to get the flag

```bash
# nc -lvnp 1234
